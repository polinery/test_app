# Car Listings Incremental Loader

## Overview

This application is designed to perform incremental loading of car listings data. It efficiently fetches and stores only the new or updated data from car listing sources, ensuring that your database remains up-to-date without redundant data processing.

## Features

- **Incremental Loading**: Only new or modified listings are loaded, reducing processing time and resource usage.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
- **Configurable**: Supports configuration options for different data sources and update intervals.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (or any other supported database with minor adjustments)
- **Dependencies**: Listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-listings-loader.git
   cd car-listings-loader
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your database and configure the connection in the `config.ini` file.

4. Run the initial setup to prepare the database:

   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```

## Configuration

The application uses a `config.ini` file for configuration. Below is an example of what the configuration file might look like:

```ini
[database]
host = localhost
port = 5432
user = yourusername
password = yourpassword
dbname = car_listings

[loader]
data_source_url = https://example.com/api/car-listings
update_interval = 86400  # Time in seconds
```

## Usage

To start the incremental loading process, simply run the following command:

```bash
python load_data.py
```

This will fetch and store new or updated car listings data based on the last successful run.

## Logging

The application logs important events and errors to a log file located at `logs/app.log`. You can adjust the logging level and format in the `config.ini` file.

## Error Handling

The application is designed to handle common errors gracefully, including:

- **Network Errors**: Retries fetching data in case of network failures.
- **Database Errors**: Ensures database integrity by rolling back incomplete transactions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure that your database credentials are correct and that the database server is running.
- **Missing Data**: Check the logs in `logs/app.log` for any errors related to data fetching or processing.
